# hayami - 早見

`hayami`, meaning "chart" or "table" in Japanese, is a collection of optimized implementations of the `SymbolMap` trait.
These were written for use in the [`rain-lang` project](https://gitlab.com/rain-lang) due to a recurring need for this
data structure, but are suitable for general use as well. For more information on individual implementations and/or the
`SymbolMap` trait itself, please consult the documentation for each of those crates:

- `hayami-im`: [![hayami-im documentation](https://docs.rs/hayami-im/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/hayami-im)
